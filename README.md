# The ADS-B Receiver Project :airplane:

## Run ADS-B/UAT related applications without the overhead!

This project continues to realize that for some, Docker and premade images are not the most optimal solution.

It would seem as of late the move towards premade and as well as Docker and other PaaS images with preinstalled software are the rage within the community. The problem is Docker images require additional software and overhead in order to run and premade images lack installation options. Solutions such as these come preinstalled with software you may never wish to use as part of the image. What this project offers is the possibility for less overhead and better performance, depending on your installation choices of course, on a wide range of devices and hardware archetectures while installing only the applications you want natively.

## Obtaining And Using This Software

### Manual installations...

    sudo apt-get install git
    git clone https://github.com/jprochazka/adsb-receiver
    cd ~/adsb-receiver
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

### Updating existing installations...

Your local repositories master branch will be updated each time install.sh is executed that is unless either the `--development` or `--branch <branch>` switch is used. Unless you are testing an upcoming release or wishing to contribute to the project you will generally not need to use either of these switches.

    cd ~/adsb-receiver
